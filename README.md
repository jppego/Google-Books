# Introduction 
Hash Code is a team programming competition, organized by Google, for students and professionals around the world [1]. It allows participants to share skills and connect with other coders as they work together to solve a problem modeled off a real Google engineering challenge! In small teams of two to four, coders all over the world tackle the first problem through Qualification Round. Though this round is hosted online, teams can come together virtually to compete side-by-side in locally coordinated Hash Code Hubs. The top teams from this round are invited to join the virtual World Finals.
The problem that the authors present here was proposed as the challenge for the Qualification Round of 2020 [2] and is related to Google Books [3]. “Google Books is a project that embraces the value books bring to our daily lives. It aspires to bring the world's books online and make them accessible to everyone. In the last 15 years, Google Books has collected digital copies of 40 million books in more than 400 languages, partly by scanning books from libraries and publishers all around the world” [4].

# Solution
The authors implemented and tested three meta-heuristic search algorithms for a combinatory problem, namely of scheduling a set of libraries to sign up books for scanning. The problem was proposed by Google in their Online Qualification Round 2020 of team programming competition Hash Code. The problem consists of scheduling a set of libraries, whose goal is to maximize the total score obtained from scanning different books over a defined period of days. Two determinist solutions were found for the 6 problem files proposed during the competition. Furthermore, three optimization algorithms (simulated annealing, tabu search and genetic algorithm) were implemented to solve the problem starting from a random initial (non-optimal) solution. All three algorithms were able to find better solutions in a reasonable interval of time, though with a variety of performances. The experimental results demonstrate that at least two of the problems have a solution which exceeds the deterministic solutions found.
