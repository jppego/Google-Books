Aircraft Landing Problem - Static case with multi-runways

# Introduction 
Hash Code is a team programming competition, organized by Google, for students and professionals around the world [1]. It allows participants to share skills and connect with other coders as they work together to solve a problem modeled off a real Google engineering challenge! In small teams of two to four, coders all over the world tackle the first problem through Qualification Round. Though this round is hosted online, teams can come together virtually to compete side-by-side in locally coordinated Hash Code Hubs. The top teams from this round are invited to join the virtual World Finals.
The problem that the authors present here was proposed as the challenge for the Qualification Round of 2020 [2] and is related to Google Books [3]. “Google Books is a project that embraces the value books bring to our daily lives. It aspires to bring the world's books online and make them accessible to everyone. In the last 15 years, Google Books has collected digital copies of 40 million books in more than 400 languages, partly by scanning books from libraries and publishers all around the world” [4].

# Solution
To reach optimal solutions to the problem the DOCplex mp and cp solvers were used. Regarding multiple runaways sequence landing problem, using CP model, was developed an original approach that was proven very efficient considering the obtained feasible results.
